			<h3>Welcome to MattPlotzker.com</h3>
		<p>	
		I am currently a freelance grant writer and consultant, and am a graduate 
		from the University of Richmond with a B.A. in Political Science. 
		As a grant writer, I manage the grant application process of non-profit 
		organizations to research grant prospects and advise clients on which grants and 
		foundations to approach and how to do so. I am also a member of Manhattan Young 
		Democrats and have volunteered with New York Cares and during college in the Richmond school system. 
		</p>
		<h3>Grant Writing</h3>
		<p>	
		As a grant writer, I manage the grant application process of non-profit organizations 
		to research grant prospects and advise clients on which grants and foundations to approach 
		and how to do so. I utilize my writing, editing, and research skills to write grant proposals 
		as requested, in time to meet deadlines, and prepare the proposal for submission. My role includes 
		reviewing previous funders for renewal potential and searching online grant directories for grants 
		to similar organizations. Further project management includes formatting budgets, listing expenses, 
		outlining project descriptions, and providing the statement of need for the project. Developing the 
		case for the proposal also comprises detailing the program evaluation methods and sustainability of 
		funding sources, as well as liaising with the nonprofits and foundations throughout grant application process.
		</p>	
		<h3>Performing Arts</h3>
		<p>	
		My passions in life include music, acting, travel, and much of arts and culture. Since a young age, 
		I have been in musical and theatre groups. I’ve had lead roles in musical theatre productions in high school 
		and college, sang in choirs that have performed in Carnegie Hall and toured Prague, Budapest, and other parts 
		of the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary, and I’ve played trumpet and sang vocals in a jazz band.
		I’ve also played guitar, keyboard, and sang vocals in various rock bands in NYC, sang in and directed a co-ed a cappella 
		group, taken voice lessons since high school and studied opera, wrote music and lyrics for a one-act musical, have written 
		my own songs, and even started and instructed an a cappella group for middle school students. Recently, I even recorded vocals 
		and harmonies on a friend’s solo record debut, and hopefully will play in a new band soon.
